## Objectives
- Implements a request/response type network server application in Python by using socket programming to interact with the Internet Protocol Stack of the host OS.
- Implements a custom client application in the same fashion that will be used to interact with the server.

## Running the program
- Open two terminals, each in the project directory.
- FIRST, in one terminal:
```python3 weather_server.py```
- NEXT, in the other terminal:
```python3 weather_client.py```
- Do all interacting via the client.
